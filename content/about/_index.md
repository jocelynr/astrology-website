*currently nineteen, a rising sophomore in college, feel free to follow me on twitter and instagram!*

just a little about myself:

i've been interested in zodiac signs ever since i was in middle school. however, it wasn't until my senior yr in high school that i began to question how and why zodiacs exist. that's when i began to study my natal chart and realized thats there is way more than just our sun sign.
