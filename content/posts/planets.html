	<p>each planet contains different aspects of a person's personality, drive, or character.</p>

	<p>the plantes are mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune & pluto.</p>

	<p>all of these planets have signs and house placements which make every individual unique. some may have the same placements and/or signs or have their sister signs which is why some may bond quicker with some than others, or some may feel that they've met that person before.</p>
