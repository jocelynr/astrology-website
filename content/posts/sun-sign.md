in astrology someone's sun sign determines ego, identity, and "role" in life. it's the core of who someone is.

these signs can be placed in different houses which go more in depth about who you are, one thing to always keep in mind is to never dictate choices or attitude based on what your sign or chart say, for the most part they are accurate but it can vary based on someone else in your life.
